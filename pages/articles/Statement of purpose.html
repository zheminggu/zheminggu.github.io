					<h1>Personal Statement</h1>
					<p class="normal indent">
							My career goal is to be a Computer Game programmer. In order to create a more reliable and fancier world for computer game players, lead them to somewhere over the rainbow, I am eager to deepen my knowledge and skills in the Computer Science, and finally combine my knowledge with the game industry. That is why I am here to apply for your graduate program, taking a further step to achieve my career goal.
						</p><p class="normal indent">	
							To trace my undergraduate experience, you will witness a wide range of attempts, a long path to the grail and an unchanged enthusiasm of Artificial Intelligence (AI).  With a pure childhood dream to build up my own AI, I initially majored in Software Engineering to learn the fundamental skills of coding and designing of basic software. I even joined the Embed System Lab because I used to simply view AI as robotics. However, I soon realized the difference between robotic and AI, then I decided to continue to pursue my real passion. In addition, I finished a "Library Intelligent Book Picking Machine" and won the third prize of Creative Design Competition of the North China University Student Robot Competition based on my work in the Embed System Lab. I then joined the Game Theory Lab to learn more theoretical knowledge of AI, such as Alpha-Beta algorithm and Monte Carlo Tree. Using these algorithms, I developed my own Surakarta Chess AI, and won the first prize in the game competition of "Liang Jiang new area Chongqing University of Technology cup". However, achieving such honors again made me even more confused about what it really is deep in my heart. Building Artificial Intelligence "creature" is supposed to be more innovative and fancier than what I can imagine. There is still something obscure blocking the way to my Utopia.
						</p><p class="normal indent">	
							I continued to search the little spark of my true interests until one of my friends invited me to join the Digital Art Lab to produce games, which need AI to control NPC automatically. There I started using Unity Game Engine and other software. Because of our team lacked expertise in art design, I further learned painting and drawing with Photoshop and SAI, editing and affecting video clips with Adobe Premiere and Adobe After Effects, supporting my game developing team in both technical and arty matters. In addition to producing artworks for my workmates, I started to investigate the game AI on my own. The first algorithm I learned and tried is the A* pathfinding algorithm, a classical start for beginners. After getting used to coding with C# and Unity, I started to design an AI system to control NPC’s attack motion, including behavior, decision and strategy, basing on my own understanding. This time, I finally felt I am in the right place to chasing my dream directly. Though it took me two years to find the best path to my career goal, I fit right in each constitution quickly and have always done a great job. Everything I have experienced is worthwhile because the skill sets eventually build me up.
						</p><p class="normal indent">
							After I mastered various traditional Game AI algorithms, I expanded my vision to the field of Machine Learning. Fortunately, Unity’s Machine Learning Agents (ML-Agents) offers me a chance to add Machine Learning to my existing Game AI system. I used its reinforcement learning algorithm to train a target tracking model, which can realize simple pathfinding function. The charming effect of Machine Learning attracted me to a brand-new area of Artificial Intelligence, which I suddenly realized is the technique I have been seeking for so long. I drown myself into Machine Learning, reading relevant papers, learning Python and TensorFlow. Moreover, I modified the AI framework I wrote before to merge the basic AI algorithm and Machine Learning technique, in order to make the NPC acting more like real people.
						</p><p class="normal indent">
							Due to my outstanding performance in the Digital Art Lab, one of my professors recommended me to participate in the Virtual and Simulation summer training in my junior year. I was one of the handful undergraduate students in the camp that was mainly composed of Ph.D. students from Virtual and Simulation Lab, but I excelled in Unreal Engine’s lighting production, blueprint control, and physical effects after a few days of self-learning. One week later, the professor grouped us to produce different simulation project, I was assigned to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization light show simulation project. With my experience in game development and coordinating skills, I became the leader of my group, which included both undergraduate and graduate students. I managed the whole project, designed the working schedule and figured out the method of team cooperation and work-sharing process in Unreal Engine. I designed the lighting behavior architecture by my own to meet the professor’s requirement, and mainly undertook the coding with Unreal blueprints. In the last week of the summer camp, I finally achieved the behavior control task of hundreds of lights, and successfully completed the project by leading and technically supporting my group. In the end, my work amazed the professor and other senior students, which contributed to my future internship recommendation.
						</p><p class="normal indent">
							In my senior year, I was recommended to an internship at the Renmin University of China. During the internship, I was tasked by the "Quintessence Sichuan Opera Simulation Virtual Person" project, to simulate and advertise the intangible cultural heritage. In this project, my major work was based on using the Unreal Engine and Noitom motion capture equipment. I undertook the architecture design and mainly blueprint coding, to create real-time interaction. Wearing the motion capture equipment, people can control the character on the screen, waving their hand to switch the opera mask or fire spit. What’s more, I also helped my workmate to solve the equipment connecting problems. Finally, the task was completed on time with high quality, successfully exhibited at the 2018 World VR Congress in Jiangxi Province. 
						</p><p class="normal indent">
							I made so much effort not only in labs but also in my academic courses. I got involved in many relevant courses of game developing, game engine introduction and earned good grades.
						</p><p class="normal indent">
							Thus, I am here to apply for your graduate program for advanced study and cutting-edge research AI, machine learning, AI game design, and computer science. I believe my passion and hardworking will make an innovative Game programmer and a leading person in this area. Please contact me should you have any questions regarding my application.
