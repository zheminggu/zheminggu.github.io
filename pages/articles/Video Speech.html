							Hi, my name is Zheming Gu, a student from Beijing Institute of University. My career goal is to be a Computer Game programmer. So I am applying for your programming specialization.
					</p><p class="normal indent">	When I was a child, I was dreaming of making artificial intelligence which can talk with people, and serve people for their life. 
					</p><p class="normal indent">	And I am also a big fan of computer games. Interacting with the NPCs in games, I got known to their worlds and stories. 
					</p><p class="normal indent">	With the dream of building AI, I majored in Software Engineering in college, to learn the fundamental skills of coding and designing basic software. Due to the ambition of building an AI by my own hand, I joined the Embed System Lab, finished a "Library Intelligent Book Picking Machine" and won the third prize of Creative Design Competition of the North China University Student Robot Competition. 
					</p><p class="normal indent">	However, I soon realized it was not the kind of AI that I wanted to learn, so I turned to the Game Theory Lab soon, to learn more theoretical knowledge of Artificial Intelligence, such as Alpha-Beta algorithm and Monte Carlo Tree. Using these algorithms, I developed my own Dots and Box Chess AI with C++, and won the first prize in the game competition of "Liang Jiang new area Chongqing University of Technology cup". But, achieving such honors again made me even more confused. Which kind of AI do I really want to build? An AI "creature" is supposed to be more innovative and fancier. 
					</p><p class="normal indent">	At that time, I recalled the love of computer games and finally found my answer deep in my mind. I want to build something related to games. Then I joined the Digital Art Lab to develop games. I started using Unity Game Engine and other software to contribute to my games’ better effect. I learned painting and drawing with Photoshop and SAI, editing and affecting video clips with Adobe Premiere and Adobe After Effects. I also accomplished my own NPC AI system coding with C# and Unity, it was designed to control NPC’s attack motion, including behavior, decision, and strategy, basing on my own understanding of AI in games. And a Dialogue system to make the NPC communicate with players. 
					</p><p class="normal indent">	Due to my outstanding performance in the Digital Art Lab, one of my professors recommended me to a Virtual and Simulation lab’s summer training with graduate students and doctors in my junior year. I was assigned to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization light show simulation project which built with Unreal Engine. With my experience in game development and coordinating, I became the leader of my group. I managed the whole project, designed the working schedule and figured out the method of team cooperation and work-sharing process in Unreal Engine. I also designed the lighting behavior architecture by my own to meet the professor’s requirement, and mainly undertook the coding with Unreal blueprints. In the last week of the summer camp, I finally achieved the behavior control task of hundreds of lights, and successfully completed the project by leading and technically supporting my group. 
					</p><p class="normal indent">	In the end, this program contributed to my future internship recommendation. In my senior year, I was recommended to an internship at the Renmin University of China. During the internship, I was tasked by the "Quintessence Sichuan Opera Simulation Virtual Person" project, to simulate and advertise the intangible cultural heritage. In this project, I undertook the architecture design and mainly blueprint coding, to create real-time interaction such as switch the opera mask or fire spit. I successfully connected Unreal Engine with Noitom motion capture and achieved the light control. Finally, the task was completed on time with high quality, successfully exhibited at the 2018 World VR Congress in Jiangxi Province. 
					</p><p class="normal indent">	Now, I am here to apply for your graduate program for advanced study and cutting-edge research of game programming to achieve my goal of programming AI in games.  I believe my passion and hardworking will make me an innovative Game programmer and a leading person in this area.
